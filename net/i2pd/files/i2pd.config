config i2pd
	# Set where i2pd should store its data (netDB, certificates, addresses, etc)
	# By default we store it in RAM so no data is written to ROM.
	# IMPORTANT!
	# Data is consistently rewritten. DO NOT POINT IT TO INNER ROM. Flash will
	# die.
	option data_dir '/var/lib/i2pd'

	# If you don't store i2pd data permanently, you can still choose to store only
	# netDb. If not, i2pd will be forced to do HTTP reseeding on every start.
	# Storing netDb may be useful if HTTP reseeding is not possible or blocked
	# (by censorship).
	# Even netDb doesn't take up too much space, extroot is still strongly
	# recommended to avoid flash wear-out.
	#option netdb_dir '/etc/i2pd/netDb'

	# Also you can store permanently addressbook, which is used for accessing
	# to i2p addresses using human-understandable addresses in .i2p zone.
	# If not, it will be fetched from subscription at start after 3 minutes.
	#option addressbook_dir '/etc/i2pd/addressbook'
